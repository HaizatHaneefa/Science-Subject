  description: The Little Dipper is formed out of the primary stars of Ursa Minor,
    however, they are not the only stars in the constellation. The handle of the
    Dipper is formed by the stars that mark the celestial Bear's tail, while the
    Dipper's cup is formed by the stars that mark the Beark's flank.
